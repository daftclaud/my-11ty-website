## Design and Inspiration

The Nahvalur Original Winter fountain pen embodies the serene beauty of winter landscapes in its distinctive ice blue transparent resin. This captivating color evokes the clarity of frozen lakes and the subtle hues of winter skies, making it a standout piece in any collection. The pen features elegant silver chrome trims that complement the cool tones of the resin, creating a harmonious and sophisticated aesthetic.

The Original series represents Nahvalur's commitment to combining artistic design with functional excellence. The Winter variant's transparent resin not only showcases the pen's internal mechanisms but also allows you to appreciate the interplay of light through the material. An integrated ink window enhances practicality while maintaining the pen's clean, flowing lines.

## Writing Experience

The Nahvalur Original Winter is equipped with a No. 6 stainless steel nib, available in multiple sizes including Fine, Medium, Broad, and Stub options. The nib delivers a smooth and consistent writing experience, whether you're taking quick notes or engaging in longer writing sessions.

Weighing approximately 19-20 grams and featuring balanced proportions, the Original Winter feels substantial without being heavy. The pen can be used posted or unposted, adapting to your preferred writing style.

## Filling System

True to Nahvalur's design philosophy, the Original Winter employs a reliable piston-filling mechanism that accepts only bottled ink. This system provides generous ink capacity, reducing the frequency of refills and making it ideal for daily use. The piston mechanism is smooth and easy to operate, while the transparent barrel allows you to monitor your ink levels at a glance.

The pen includes a metal piston wrench for maintenance, ensuring your fountain pen remains in optimal condition for years to come.

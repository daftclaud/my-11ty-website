## Design and Build

The Lamy 2000 Ballpoint Pen is a true icon of modern pen design, first introduced in 1966 and still regarded as one of the finest writing instruments available. Its sleek, minimalist aesthetic follows Bauhaus principles, prioritizing function and form in perfect harmony.

The seamless transition between materials enhances its ergonomic grip, offering a comfortable and controlled writing experience.

The Lamy 2000 features a retractable tip operated by a smooth push-button mechanism, ensuring effortless deployment and retraction. Subtle, nearly invisible seams and an understated clip contribute to its refined elegance, making it a pen that exudes professionalism and sophistication.

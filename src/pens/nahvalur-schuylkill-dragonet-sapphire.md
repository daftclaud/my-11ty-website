## Design and Inspiration

The Nahvalur Schuylkill series takes its name from the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia, reflecting the brand's connection to the city's vibrant culture and history. Introduced at the 2020 Philadelphia Pen Show, the series evolves the Nahvalur Original by introducing exclusive resin designs and practical enhancements.

The 2022 Dragonet Sapphire edition is a striking example of Nahvalur's creativity. Inspired by the vivid colors of tropical sea creatures, the pen features a mesmerizing blend of red and blue resin. This captivating material is paired with rose gold trims for an opulent finish. As a limited production of just 2000 pens, the Dragonet Sapphire is as exclusive as it is beautiful.

An ink window integrated seamlessly into the design enhances functionality while maintaining the pen’s aesthetic appeal.

## Design and Build

The Uniball Zento Signature was born from the desire to celebrate the small joys of creativity and reflection that arise through writing. With a minimalist design that calms the mind, the Zento Signature features a metallic body and a magnetic cap for a sleek, professional appearance. The pen is lightweight, and its wide grip section is crafted for long, comfortable writing sessions. A stylish and sturdy wire clip opens wide, making it easy to attach the pen to notebooks, folders, or documents.

## Writing Experience

The Zento Signature Gel Pen uses specially formulated ZENTO gel ink that delivers bold, vibrant black lines while reducing writing friction, feathering, and bleed-through. Whether journaling, note-taking, or signing documents, the ink sits atop paper fibers for clean, smudge-resistant lines and a consistently smooth flow. The 0.5mm fine point ensures precise strokes, ideal for both personal and professional use. The ink's deep black tone is also known to aid in memory retention—making it a favorite among students and professionals alike.

## Refill System

The Uniball Zento Signature is compatible with proprietary Zento gel ink refills. These refills are engineered for longevity and performance, ensuring uninterrupted writing with consistent ink flow. Replacing the refill is quick and easy, maintaining the pen’s status as a dependable everyday companion.
